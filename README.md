# GatePi-8CH
The 8-Channel GatePi Relay Board based on LoRa™ and RP2040 MCU is a low-power data transmission board and has all the features exactly similar to the 4 Channel Relay Board, except it has 8 relay channels for an increased capacity and efficiency. It is a low-power consumption data transmission board, that comes with an onboard CH340 USB TO UART converter, Voltage Level Translator(74HC125V), E22-400T22S/E22-900T22S SMA antenna connector that covers 433/868/915 MHz frequency band, 8-Ch Relays, IPEX antenna connector, LoRa™ Spread Spectrum Modulation technology with auto multi-level repeating. GatePi is developed to enable data transmission up to 5 KM through the serial port.

## RP2040
Raspberry Pi RP2040 Microcontroller Chip is the debut microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. It brings high performance, low cost, and ease of use to the microcontroller space. The RP2040 has a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set. It's augmented with a unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem and provides unrivaled power and flexibility.

## LoRa Module(E22-400T22S)
LoRa stands for Long Range Radio and is mainly targeted for M2M and IoT networks. This technology will enable public or multi-tenant networks to connect a number of applications running on the same network. E22-400T22S1B is a wireless serial port module (UART) based on SEMTECH's SX1268 RF chip. It has multiple transmission modes,working in the (410.125MHz~493.125MHz) frequency band (default 433.125MHz), LoRa spread spectrum technology, TTL level output,compatible with 3.3V and 5V IO port.

## Relays
The GatePi 8channel board is consist of 8 relay modules for connecting the four different appliances or any devices you want to control through our GatePi board.

## USB Port, and Boot Button
USB port is used for debugging python programmes in our this board, and for powering up this board. Boot button is used to make GatePi 8Ch board in Boot mode for updating firmware to it.
