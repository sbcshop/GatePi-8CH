# GatePi-8CH
The 8-Channel GatePi Relay Board based on LoRa™ and RP2040 MCU is a low-power data transmission board and has all the features exactly similar to the 4 Channel Relay Board, except it has 8 relay channels for an increased capacity and efficiency. It is a low-power consumption data transmission board, that comes with an onboard CH340 USB TO UART converter, Voltage Level Translator(74HC125V), E22-400T22S/E22-900T22S SMA antenna connector that covers 433/868/915 MHz frequency band, 8-Ch Relays, IPEX antenna connector, LoRa™ Spread Spectrum Modulation technology with auto multi-level repeating. GatePi is developed to enable data transmission up to 5 KM through the serial port.
